# PlatformPortalSeller_JavaProject
The project is about a virtual platform for different sellers, to sell their items to buyers.
There is a portal, each for customer as well as seller.

For running the code:
Open two terminals: one for customer, one for seller.
For Seller part: type the following command "g++ PortalMain.cpp" and "./a.out"
For Buyer part: type the following command "javac PlatformMain.java" and "java PlatformMain"

The products for each seller are already set in the DaneshSeller.cpp, NeilSeller.cpp and MayankSeller.cpp files.
You can List the products (here, Book and Mobile) in ascending order of either Name, or Price, by the command: List Book Name, List Book Price, respectively.
The sorted order will be listed when you type "check" in the buyer portal.
